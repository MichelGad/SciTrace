## üìÅ Projects & Dataflows

### Q: What's the difference between a project and a dataflow?
**A:** 
- **Project**: A research project that can contain multiple dataflows, tasks, and collaborators
- **Dataflow**: A specific data workflow within a project, represented as an interactive visualization

### Q: How many projects can I create?
**A:** There's no hard limit on the number of projects. The limit depends on your system resources and storage space.

### Q: Can I delete a project?
**A:** Yes, you can delete projects through the project management interface. **Warning**: This will also delete all associated dataflows and DataLad datasets.

### Q: What research types are available?
**A:** SciTrace supports four research types:
- **Environmental**: Water quality, climate data, ecological studies
- **Biomedical**: Medical research, clinical trials, health studies
- **Computational**: Machine learning, simulations, data analysis
- **General**: Custom research projects, interdisciplinary studies

## üîÑ DataLad Integration

### Q: Do I need to know DataLad to use SciTrace?
**A:** No, SciTrace provides a web interface for all DataLad operations. However, knowing DataLad can help you understand what's happening behind the scenes.

### Q: Can I use existing DataLad datasets?
**A:** Yes, you can import existing DataLad datasets into SciTrace. This feature is available through the dataflow creation interface.

### Q: Where are my datasets stored?
**A:** By default, datasets are stored in your home directory under `~/scitrace_demo_datasets/` for demo data, or in the location you specify when creating dataflows.

### Q: Can I move or rename datasets?
**A:** Yes, but you should do this through SciTrace's interface to maintain proper tracking. Moving datasets manually may break the integration.

### Q: What happens if DataLad is not installed?
**A:** SciTrace will show an error and guide you through installing DataLad. The installation script should handle this automatically.

## üìä File Management

### Q: What file types are supported?
**A:** SciTrace supports all file types. It provides special handling for:
- **Text files**: View content in browser
- **Images**: Display in browser
- **Data files**: CSV, JSON, etc.
- **Code files**: Python, R, etc. with syntax highlighting

### Q: Is there a file size limit?
**A:** The default limit is 100MB per file, but this can be configured in your web server settings. Large files are handled efficiently through DataLad's Git-annex system.

### Q: Can I upload multiple files at once?
**A:** Currently, you can upload files one at a time through the web interface. Batch upload functionality is planned for future versions.

### Q: How do I restore deleted files?
**A:** 
1. Go to your dataflow visualization
2. Look for red nodes (deleted files)
3. Click the restore button
4. Select the commit to restore from
5. The file will be restored and committed

### Q: Can I view file differences between versions?
**A:** Yes, use the Git Log feature to view commit history and file differences between versions.

## üîç Visualization & Interface

### Q: What do the different colors in the dataflow visualization mean?
**A:** 
- **Blue nodes**: Directories
- **Green nodes**: Tracked files
- **Gray nodes**: Untracked files
- **Red nodes**: Deleted files
- **Yellow nodes**: Modified files

### Q: Can I customize the visualization?
**A:** The visualization automatically reflects your data structure. Customization options are planned for future versions.

### Q: Why is my dataflow visualization empty?
**A:** This usually means:
1. No files have been added to the dataset yet
2. Files are not being tracked by DataLad
3. There's an issue with the dataset path

### Q: Can I export the visualization?
**A:** Currently, you can take screenshots of the visualization. Export functionality is planned for future versions.
