- **Red nodes**: Deleted files

### Click to Explore
- **Click any node** to view file content or metadata
- **Download files** with the download button
- **View file locations** in your system explorer
- **See file status** (tracked, modified, etc.)

### Add Files
1. **Navigate to your project directory** (shown in the dataflow)
2. **Add some files** (text files, images, data files)
3. **Return to SciTrace** and refresh the dataflow
4. **New files appear** as gray (untracked) nodes

## üíæ Save Your Work

### Commit Changes
1. **Click "Save Files"** in the dataflow interface
2. **Add a commit message**: "Added initial data files"
3. **Click "Commit Changes"**
4. **Watch the visualization update** as files turn green (tracked)

### View Commit History
1. **Click "Git Log"** in the dataflow interface
2. **See your commits** in the interactive timeline
3. **Click on commits** to view changes
4. **Use "Copy Hash"** to reference specific commits
